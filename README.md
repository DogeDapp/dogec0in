dogec0in
========

The code behind dogec0in, a chat faucet for cryptocurrencies.

Yes, I know, some of this code is kinda bad (especially the website!), and there's some dead code included, but as with whatsdoge, I've put the stuff I wrote under the MIT license, so..

There are some dependencies included. They are under their respective licenses.

The cronjob.php ran every 5 minutes by the same user that ran the bots. This was as part of an effort to try to optimise wowsuchdoge back in late January. I ran it from the home directory; dogecoind was in the same directory.
